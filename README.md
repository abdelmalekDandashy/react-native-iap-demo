A production-ready demonstration of implementing in-app purchases in React Native using [iaptic](https://www.iaptic.com) for receipt validation.

## Overview

This demo implements a complete in-app purchase flow with server-side receipt validation:

âœ¨ **Secure**: Server-side validation with iaptic  
ðŸ”„ **Reliable**: Full purchase restoration support  
ðŸŽ® **Interactive**: Token-based consumable system  
ðŸ“± **Production-Ready**: Error handling and state management

## Requirements

- Node.js 16 or newer
- npm or yarn package manager
- React Native development environment
- [iaptic](https://www.iaptic.com) account credentials
- iOS Developer Account with IAP enabled
- Android Developer Account with IAP enabled (for Android)

## Quick Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
# OR using yarn
yarn install

# Configure iaptic credentials
cp src/Config-example.ts src/Config.ts
```

### iOS Setup

1. Configure your products in App Store Connect
2. Run the app:
```bash
npm run ios
# OR using yarn
yarn ios
```

### Android Setup

1. Configure your products in Google Play Console
2. Make sure you have:
   - A Google Play Developer account
   - An app created in Google Play Console
   - In-app products configured
   - A test account added to the app's testers

3. Update your Android configuration:
   - Verify your `android/app/build.gradle` has the billing permission:
     ```gradle
     android {
         ...
         defaultConfig {
             ...
             manifestPlaceholders = [
                 ...
                 BILLING_KEY: "your_license_key_from_play_console"
             ]
         }
     }
     ```

4. Run the app:
```bash
# Method 1: Using Gradle directly (recommended)
cd android
./gradlew clean
./gradlew installPlayDebug
cd ..

# Method 2: Using React Native CLI
cd android
./gradlew clean
cd ..
yarn android --appVariant=playDebug
# OR using npm
npm run android -- --appVariant=playDebug
```

Note: The project uses multiple build variants. Always specify `playDebug` variant to ensure proper Google Play Store integration.

### Common Android Issues
1. **Build Variant Errors**: 
   - If you see "Task 'app:installDebug' not found" or similar
   - Use `installPlayDebug` instead of `installDebug`
   - Or specify `--appVariant=playDebug` with React Native CLI

2. **Package Manager Issues**:
   - If `yarn` command is not found, install it first:
     ```bash
     npm install -g yarn
     ```
   - Or use npm commands as alternatives

3. **Runtime Errors**:
   - Verify billing permission in manifest (already added)
   - Check Play Store is installed and up to date
   - Ensure test account is properly set up
   - Verify product IDs match exactly

4. **Testing**:
   - Use a real device (not emulator)
   - Sign in with a test account
   - Make sure the app is signed with the correct key
   - Verify you're using the correct product IDs
